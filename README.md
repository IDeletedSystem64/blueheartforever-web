# Blueheart, forever 💙
This is a webpage dedicated to a tribute to my late girlfriend.. really wife Alice, Blueheart was the ship name between our two OC's (Blueberry, the one I use on my profile picture here, and Astro Heart, her OC.)

(the very first art I had drawn of our characters, back in June of 2022, will be seeing a "remaster" soon.)

# I want to contribute
Help will be needed with this project, with getting a working image gallery, as well as a "memories" page run through JavaScript and JSON. In browser JS being something I'm not the most familiar with.

Additionally, you can also draw Blueheart art, which will be added to the gallery and very appreciated by me, Not many things make me as happy as seeing that somebody drew art of me or her OC's

You can find images to use as references here: https://cloud.system64.dev/index.php/s/jNwQQ8rqokWckf8

Just no NSFW, Gore or anything like that please. You can send art via email at ideleted@system64.dev, or Discord at ``sunburst.``
